    "# Korean Maritime Safety Tribunal Vessel Name Matching\n",

    "This notebook implements fuzzy string matching to identify Korean vessels across different datasets. It:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loads vessel name data from extracted vessel names and Korean vessels datasets\n",
    "2. Implements helper functions to:\n",
    "   - Remove digits from vessel names\n",
    "   - Perform fuzzy matching using token set ratio comparison\n",
    "3. Uses two-stage matching:\n",
    "   - First compares alphabetic-only parts of names\n",
    "   - Then compares full vessel names if alpha parts match\n",
    "4. Allows configurable matching thresholds for both stages\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to reliably match vessel names despite minor differences in formatting and numbering.\n"
